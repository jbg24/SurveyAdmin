Description of fields pulled from Salesforce API using simple-salesforce in salesforce_api.py file
Conventions:
 - Query fields using TableName.FieldName
 - "__r" appears after a table name if it is a "parent table" - in Salesforce, this information is pulled from a parent level
 - "__c" appear after a field name or table name that is custom made
 - In Salesforce, a field name that has spaces is usually referenced by replacing the space with an underscore, for example
   "Total of Student Currently Enrolled" becomes "Total_of_Students_Currently_Enrolled__c" with the '__c' appended because
   it's a custom field

These field are currently pulled from the "Profiled__c" table which contains all the schools that have been profiled with
pertinent information for that school and survey round:
